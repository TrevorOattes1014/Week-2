<h1>My First Website</h1>
<p class="intro">Hello World. Welcome to my first website. It is a pleasure to meet you Thanks for stopping by and please enjoy your evening.</p>
<p>My name is Trevor and I live in Perth, Ontario, Canada. I'm a journalist and a writer and I'm currently finishing my final year of university.</p>

<h2>My Favourite News Outlets:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa"target="_blank">CBC News Ottawa</a></li>

    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>A 26 year old writer. I like writing about politics and sometimes write about magic and fantasy, and I often mix the two together</p>
    <p>I currently plan on joining an environmental agency upon graduation and working in communications in some capacity. I have experience working at a Conservation Authority so I am hopeful I can find work in a similar field.</p>
    <p>I may pursue a postgrad degree in Environmental Studies at Queen's University upon finishing at uOttawa. I may also go to Carleton for a journalism postgrad. The future is kind of up in the air due to COVID. </p>
